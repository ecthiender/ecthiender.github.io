    <p>Hello, I'm writing some notes here. I see a complete white screen infront of
me, which is supposed to give me a distraction-free writing experience. But I'm
not sure if this is entirely true that it happens. For example, when I looked
at the screen it kind of felt awkward that its completely white and now I have
to surrender myself to the serene feeling of white and transcend to a higher
level to get some inspiration for my writing. But I also see a point that when
someone has already some idea on what to write about, when they see the
complete white screen they can concentrate on their mind and the just the words
that flow out of their fingers into this screen which might obviously be a very
good writing experience, to the point it is almost a dopamine trip I suppose.</p>

<p>PS: This was written while trying out a new note taking app. After writing it
out, I thought of posting it here.</p>
