    <h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>Around September 2015, with great anticipation we all started talking and
planning about a mega trip before Kabya eventually ties the marital knot. We
all meaning, Tatu, Kabya, Anandarup, Papai, Arghya and me. Rahul and Tatai da
was also roped in. It was evident though Papai won't be able to join us (as he
was in Australia!). After some initial discussion about whether we should go to
Himachal, Uttarakhand or Sikkim, Tatu found a place called Baghini glacier in
the Garhwal Himalaya in Uttarakhand. We researched a bit on the trek route and
were quited excited with the plan.</p>
<p>Enter Boro and Etosha. Kabya announced that Boro and Etosha would also join us
in the trip. That meant the experienced pro-trekkers are coming into the
picture and the level of anticipation was already reaching to bigger
proportions. Boro is also the proprietor of <a href="http://www.rockyfeet.com/">Rockyfeet</a> which meant that we
would be doing a Rockyfeet trek as well. Boro, soon enough, announced that he
has a better route and place in mind for trekking. It was called the Mandani
valley, the route is via Mandani valley across three high-altitude passes or
<em>cols</em> and coming down into Kedarnath. Without any ado we all agreed to the
trek. Boro warned us that the trek is going to be really tough and we were all
beginner and novice trekkers, except Etosha, Tatu and ofcourse Boro. Boro also
adviced us to start a cardio regime to prepare ourseleves for the trek. We all
were anxious but excited for the trek. I never managed to do any cardio regime
though.</p>
<p>The three high altitude passes that we would be crossing were Yeongbuk Col,
Bisali Col and Mahapanth Col. Our initial itinerary looked like -</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: Ransi to Saniara(2743m) to Kanara Kharak(3338m)
  Mallapaturi(3418m)(Night Stay)</li>
<li>Day 2: Mallapaturi to Thouli(3900m) to Dwara Khal(4145m) to Dogla
  Bugiyal(Night Stay)</li>
<li>Day 3: Dogla Bugiyal to Gehri Bishtoli to Mandani Bugiyal(Night Stay)</li>
<li>Day 4: Mandani Bugiyal to Yeoungbuk Col Base Camp (Night Stay)</li>
<li>Day 5: Reserve day to be used for acclimatization</li>
<li>Day 6: Yeoungbuk Col BC to Yeoungbuk Col(4700m) to Bisali Col(4750m) to
  Mahapanth Tal(4750m) (Night Stay)</li>
<li>Day 7: Mahapanth Tal to Mahapanth Col to Kedarnath(Stay)</li>
<li>Day 8: Kedarnath to Gourikund to Haridwar(stay)</li>
</ul>
<p>We would be reaching Ransi from Haridwar via Ukhimath. Ransi is a tiny village
around 2 hours drive from Ukhimath.</p>
<h2>The trip</h2>
<p>On May 27th 2016 we started our journey from Bangalore enroute to the Garhwal
Himalaya where none knows what awaits us.</p>
<p>The start of the journey was not uneventful as we had to skamper at the last
moment for packing and we had a lot of other work to take care of.
Khushi had a last moment interview which made the the adrenaline rush kick even
more at the beginning of the journey.
Finally, my sack was under 9 kg as Khushi's was under 8kgs; and we were happy
to have a lighter sack for such a difficult trek.</p>
<p>The start of the journey was boring as we had to catch a flight from Bangalore
to Delhi. From Bangalore, me, Khushpreet and Etosha started our voyage. In
Delhi, Kabya and Amit Da (a.k.a Mama) would join us.</p>
<p>We reached Haridwar early in the morning</p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>Tatu woke us up shouting that a lot of great tits are fluttering around.</p>
