    *Meta: initial idea was the first part of the story above; it seemed
    interesting to think about how our technology has evolved far from our
    ancestors' imagination but in a wrong way, to the point where we curse them and
    think we would have a better world without them. the impact part came while
    writing it down, as my thoughts started rationalising why and how and when
    could technology affect the environment, and hence towards the later half the
    writing has got more concerned about the impact part and its reason.*

<p>What conjures up in your mind when I talk about Harry Potter&#8217;s pensieve, where
one can store memories. Memories are stored in some kind of a silver sink with
silken threads taken out of your mind, which represents each memory. Or about a
speaking tree. Where one can go and talk to the tree to store one&#8217;s memories,
and the tree speaks back by relieving one&#8217;s past memory. I don&#8217;t exactly know
what might conjure up in your mind, but I&#8217;m pretty sure whatever visual you
have in your mind, it is in the past world. In an ancient world. Okay, maybe not
ancient, but certainly not in the current age of digital technology with glass
panels in you hands and living in glass&nbsp;buildings.</p>
<p>Why is&nbsp;that?</p>
<p>If we look at history and imagination of people in the past, we see very
interesting things in terms of magic or fantasy. I would go further and argue
that prediction about the future was also very similar. The common thing about
them, I believe, is -&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>But the technologies that they imagined were all &#8212; for lack of a better word,
I know its a little-bit hand-wavy, I have not set any context or definition,
but here you go &#8212; <em>organic</em>.  If we look at today&#8217;s machines, they don&#8217;t seem
to be what our ancestors had imagined our advanced technology or magic/fantasy
might look&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>They would have imagined some kind of silver sink with silken threads in them
to store memories. Akin to the pensieve in Harry Potter.  Or maybe some kind of
old aged tree to which you can talk to save and retrieve memories.  But today
we capture our memories through digital machines and upload them on the
global-scape of information aka the Internet; or store them away in our clunky
yet fragile external hard&nbsp;disks.</p>
<p>Who would have thought giant machine spitting out smoke and steam with revolving
gears much larger than men, could do miracles. People in the past always
thought, riding on the broomstick was the way to fly. Or maybe some magic
carpet. If these seem to far fetched into fantasy, maybe the critical thinkers
and tinkerers of the olden days had thought about much realistic machines which
could, say, fly or run on the&nbsp;ground.</p>
<p>But technologists since the ancient times have brought in technology but always
in a crude way. The motto was make the thing work and not really preconcieve
the consequences of the technology. As a result we as a race have developed a
natural tendency to develop new technolgies in that way. Over the period of
centuries this has impacted the environment we live&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Technology which has been widely accepted, i.e. things after electricity, has
been disruptive in a negative way. Obviously the concept or the scientific
discovery behind these technologies is sheer breathtaking and one can only
wonder in such astonishing studies and findings. But the method they have been
impacting our lives is probably inorganic. Could we have built technolgies that
were more organic and hence it could fall into the natural cycle of any
biosphere? But then we have to figure out what do we mean by organic technology
and inorganic technology.  Even if we postpone defining the terms, can&#8217;t we say
that when humans discovered they could make bricks out of clay and put them
together to build stronger houses, or they could make stronger and even more
effective weapons with use of a metal instead of stones which occur naturally
in the Earth&#8217;s crust albeit you have to excavate it, or they could make
something like fire out of almost nothing and then use it to cook food to get
rid of various diseaeses of the food or use it to stay warm etc, that they were
discovering organic technolgies? So where can we draw line saying that humans
switched from organic technology to inorganic technology? Can we say that the
industrial revolution flipped the tables around? What would we mean by that? Do
we mean smoke producing steam engines killed the organic technology development
or the noise making huge machines in factory? So then by that we would mean
machines when/which started creating environmental pollution were the first
ones to be inorganic.  But then who would know that a smoke creating steam
engine could be inorganic.  People were already burining huge fires to fill
their needs. There were already smoke pollution happening since centuries. We
can pull out probably even more examples to show that what we thik as a
industrial age technology and that being inorganic we can correspondingly find
technologies from the pre-industrial era to be inorganic as well. So we can see
the line between what we are trying to call organic/inorganic technology is
blurred. Technologies what we like to think as inorganic have been there for
centuries without being disruptive to the environment, and equally organic
technologies have existed for centuries and continues to be developed even now.
We have still not grounded on what we mean by organic technology and what we
mean by inorganic technology. Before we do that and delve into deeper
discussion of a timeline of important technologies over the centuries and
classifying them as being organic/inorganic (I&#8217;d like to do that), I&#8217;d like to
present another&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p>What if the type of technology(organic/inorganic) is not the problem, but the
scale of its use is. What I mean by that is burning of fire is a technology
which can have its tremendous benefits - like cooking food to make it safe from
germs, or staying warm and fend off animals in night, it does have its share of
being adverse on the environment. It produces carbon dioxide and carbon
monoxide and other gases which have a negative effect on the environment.
Burning fire for centuries did not affect the environment, but now even burning
a small fire in a remote hill station on a cold night (which is essential for
survival) contributes its fair share of air pollution to our current
environment; leaving out the huge number of factories, sheer number of
autmobiles etc. So does classifying technologies into being organic/inorganic
really make sense to understand what impact it has on our environment? Or do we
concentrate more on the scale of its use, which actually seem to contribute to
the current problem we percieve we are having with technology?  So to
understand the problem how technology has been impacting our environment in a
negative way, we have conlcuded there are two options to investigate&nbsp;to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The sheer scale of the uses of technology. (too much population - everybody
wants a car - and everyone has to drive to office at 9am - probably causing
massive air pollution at those very timings. [probably not only the scale
but our current way of living and the way society functions also
contributes to negative impact of the environment - think about everybody
wants a car and everybody has to get to office at&nbsp;9am])</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the type of technologies - organic and inorganic.  organic: good, recycles
itself, no impact on nature; inorganic: bad, byproducts and un-recyclable
waste, and have negative impact on&nbsp;nature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next task is to think, dig deep into these two&nbsp;points.</p>
