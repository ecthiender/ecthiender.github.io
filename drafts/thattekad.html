    <p>It was a comedy of unfortunate events and bad luck. It was 2pm when we reached
Munnar, which we were supposed to reach in the morning. It has already been a
long day, and we still have to travel around 90 more kilometers to reach
Thattekad. We got down at Munnar, from where we have to catch another local bus
to reach Kothamangalam, and from there another to auto to reach Thattekad.
Thattekad is a famous bird sanctuary in Kerala - home to the great Dr. Salim
Ali and home to many endemic species of the Western Ghats including Sri Lanka
frogmouth, Malabar Trogon, Malabar grey hornbill and many others. But an early
morning fiasco and then series of unfortunate events had set us&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Amidst all of this, I could not help notice how beautiful Munnar was. It is a
tiny tea-estate town and hill-station situated in the Western Ghats at an
altitude of 1600m in Kerala. It is home to a number of endemic species of
Western Ghats including the Nilgiri Thar, Nilgiri langur, Nilgiri wood-pigeon,
Indian gaur, the grizzled giant squirrel and many other endemic birds.
Munnar&#8217;s landscape seems like a dreamy haze of some tropical utopian vision.
Vast stretches of undulating sheds of green in any direction you look. And a
not-so bright light illuminating all of the green from among the clouds. The
vast hills of complete green, are tea plantations. All of them neatly trimmed
and shaped to be aesthetically pleasing. Alteast that is what it seems like.  I
was appreciating Munnar while we were sipping on tea in the bus stand waiting
for the onward bus to Kothamangalam and enjoying this beauty.  I make a mental
note to myself to come back to Munnar, even if just for the endemic species.
Before we finished our tea, the bus started to leave. Hurriedly we payed the
tea-shop and got on the&nbsp;bus.</p>
<p>It took another 2.5 hours for us to reach Kothamangalam. The bus from Munnar
doesn&#8217;t go to Thattekad directly. You have to get down at a small town called
Kothamangalam, and take an auto or another local bus from there. It was 4.30 pm
when we reached Kothamangalam. We did not waste any time and took an auto from
there. Thattekad is 12 km from Kothamangalam, which takes around 30 minutes to
reach by an&nbsp;auto.</p>
<p>Finally, we reached Thattekad, the entrance of the bird sanctuary, at around
5pm. By now, we had already lost the whole day.  According to our plans, we
were supposed to reach Thattekad around noon. We were upset and not in a very
good mood when we reached Thatekkad. One, we were very late and lost half a
day.  Second, the memories of the unfortunate events were still haunting&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>Our accomodation was in a homestay near Thattekad bird sanctuary. Atleast
that&#8217;s what we knew. When we reached Thattekad, we discovered that it is not
close to the bird sanctuary, it is inside the sanctuary! Well, almost. It is
just beside the boundary of the sanctuary. Meaning there is a primitive
barb-wire boundary between the sanctuary and the area of the homestay.
Practically, its the same patch of forest. The bird sanctuary (and the
homestay) is right amongst the deep broad-leaved evergreen/semi-evergreen
tropical rain forest. Just beside the sanctuary, Periyar - the longest river in
Kerala, flows by. Periyar river is very wide. There trees are tall and old. I&#8217;m
very poor with identifying trees, and any name of the flora would have escaped
me.  But looking at the trees of the forest, it was very apparent that they
were an old bunch of folks. The homestay is also the home for the family who
run the homestay. We later found out that the homestay owner is also a
naturalist, and has been birding since he was 7 years&nbsp;old.</p>
<p>When we were reaching the homestay we saw Mr. X eagerly waiting at the gate for
us to arrive. As soon as we arrived, we did not even keep all our luggages, he
announced that there are some Grey-fronted green pigeons and a Malabar grey
hornbill in the fig tree right next to the house. I clumsily dumped all of my
stuff, grabbed my camera and ran outside to get a glimpse of the pigeons and
the hornbill. Within seconds, I had forgotten all the woes I had from the early
morning&nbsp;fiascos.</p>
<p>It was getting dark, but we still strolled around the homestay area and not
surprisingly we found Malabar Grey hornbill, Grey-fronted green pigeons,
Lesser hill mynas, White-bellied treepies, Grey junglefowls, Greater
racket-tailed drongos and could hear lots of barbets calling. We also found
egrets, a single grey-heron and a flock of lesser whistling ducks at a nearby&nbsp;pond.</p>
<p>From that point on we embarked on intense and fully-invovled bird-watching
sessions from morning to evening until the sunlight permitted. Here are few of
the images and&nbsp;videos.</p>
